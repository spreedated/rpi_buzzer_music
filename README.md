# Play Music (actual notes) through a Piezo Buzzer (Speaker) -- PWM

This script let's you play the Tetris Theme A through a Buzzer (Piezo) style speaker.<br>
Feel free to add more songs, a description on how to is in the commentary.<br>
<br>
Make sure to select the correct GPIO Pin, I've used #12, since it's one of the two Hardware PWM's pf the RPi 3.<br>
Every other Pin will work aswell, but it'll be software emulated and may result in inaccurate results and high CPU load.<br>
